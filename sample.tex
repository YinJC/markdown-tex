# markdown-tex

markdown processor in \TeX. 

## supported syntax

So far, you can write normal paragraph, codelist, quoatatio, itemize list, and enumerate list. 

As inline styles, `tt`, *italic*, and **bold** are available. You can also put some inline equations like this: $\int_0^1\frac{1}{x}dx = \infty$, although most of TeX macros are invalid.

## example

Inshort, you can write something like below.
Below is a `codeline` block. 

    codeline
        another codenline
    a = a + 2
    printf("Hello World");
    
    return true;

Note that you can't use $\backslash$ and parens ($\lbrace,\rbrace$) literally anywhere, and neither is true within codeblocks.

Here is a enumerate list.

1. enumerate

1. the markdown way

## subsection

This is an itemize list. 

* this block
* will
* turn 
* into an 
* itemize

And a quotation. 

> Quote Somethin
> Really **Awesome**!
